Here's a step-by-step description of what Shell script is doing 

chmod: chmod is a command in Unix-like operating systems that is used to change the permissions of files and directories.

u+x: In this command, u refers to the "user" or owner of the file, and +x means to add the execute permission for the owner.

0-hello_world: 0-hello_world is the name of the file or script that is being modified.

Combining these steps, the command chmod u+x 0-hello_world modifies the permissions of the file 0-hello_world, specifically granting the owner of the file the permission to execute it.

After executing this command, the owner of the 0-hello_world file will be able to run it as a script or program, typically by executing ./0-hello_world in the terminal. This assumes that the file contains valid executable code or commands that will be executed when the script is run.
